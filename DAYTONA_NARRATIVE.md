# What Daytona Means — Ryan Massfeller

*Written February 14, 2026. For future reference and for the soul of this project.*

I was born across the street from the World Center of Racing. Not figuratively — literally across International Speedway Boulevard from the place where speed became religion. My grandfather Max was a judge in this town. My grandmother Bettie was a nurse at Halifax for forty-seven years. My uncle Beaver mastered the waves at the inlet before leaving for the North Shore, where he nearly died face-first into the reef at Pipeline and came back anyway, because that's what Massfellers do. We don't leave Daytona. Daytona doesn't leave us.

My father Richard raced Formula Vee — real open-wheel, real downforce, real consequences — on the same asphalt where Earnhardt would later make turn 4 immortal. His car number is probably buried in a paper logbook in the SCCA Central Florida Region archives, in the same filing cabinet as a thousand other Saturday warriors who never made the national stage but who knew exactly what 31 degrees of banking felt like at speed. Those records aren't online. They're in boxes. That's fine. He knows his number. I'll find it.

The gate code to drive on that track was 1959 — the year they built the place. How original.

I grew up in those grandstands with a RadioShack scanner pressed to my ear, laughing at the team comms, not knowing I was developing a lifelong obsession with radio, signals, and the way information moves between people who trust each other under pressure. I watched Gordon lose the races he should have won. I watched Earnhardt win the ones he had no right to. I watched Earnhardt die in turn 4 on the last lap of the 2001 500 and understood for the first time that speed has a price.

The Sunoco 76 ball sat out in turn 3 like a second sun — this massive orange sphere that only real fans remember, because they tore it down in 2004 when Sunoco took over and the sport decided its history was worth less than a sponsorship deal. Dale Jr. saved the one from North Wilkesboro. The one from Daytona is gone.

Scott Russell — Mr. Daytona, five Daytona 200 wins, a man who crashed on lap one of the '95 race, leapt over his own fallen Kawasaki, got back on, and still won over a fuming Carl Fogarty — is a personal friend. His Troy Lee Designs Indian Chief helmet is one of the most iconic paint jobs in motorcycle racing history. He races number 1 because he earned it. He taught me that legends don't always make the front page; sometimes they just live down the road and answer when you call.

And now I take my own kids to the Rolex 24. We stay up all night in the garage area, shivering on aluminum benches, huddled together under whatever we brought that isn't warm enough, just trying to make it until the sun comes up over turn 1. And when it does, and the cars are still out there, and your kid looks up at you with that face that says *this is the coolest thing that has ever happened* — that's Daytona. That's what it means.

The Daytona 500 is this weekend. The kickoff race of the entire NASCAR season. Who in their right mind puts the Super Bowl of their sport as race one? NASCAR did. Because Daytona doesn't wait.

## The Why — Uncle Sam and Uncle Beaver

Two men shaped the way I talk to machines, and neither one of them ever used a computer the way you'd expect.

### Uncle Sam

My mother's younger brother, Sam Troia, was born six weeks premature on December 2, 1949, in the far northern Berkshires — the tiny industrial manufacturing town of North Adams, Massachusetts. Medical care in 1949 wasn't what it is today. Jaundiced and struggling, the nurses placed baby Sam in a hyperbaric chamber — what they called an Iron Lung — to help him breathe. "Built on a Friday" is slang for rounded corners and missing parts, because fatigued workers race through mundane tasks to make it to the weekend. Being born on a Friday in a small-town hospital meant Sam was left in a dangerously oxygen-rich environment for several days. The oxygen caused permanent blindness that would change his life forever.

He graduated from Columbia. He lived alone in New York City. My timeline intersected Sam's when he was 34 years old. He wasn't just a holiday uncle — I vividly remember him helping my Grandmother Mary make his favorite cookies, "Date Nut Snacks," meticulously pitting and dicing piles of dates. I would sit with wonder watching Sam jam on an electronic piano, somehow masterfully flowing from key to key without missing a beat.

My mother served as his watchful second set of eyes. My eldest son is named Sam.

### Uncle Beaver

My uncle Stephen Henry "Beaver" Massfeller — aside from being a Pipeline Masters competitor and one of the best big-wave surfers Florida ever produced — was just about the nicest human being I have ever met. We would go see movies and then have long philosophical discussions over Steak 'n Shake. The salt in his wisdom came at a high cost. The year I was born, Beaver suffered a massive head injury while competing at an elite level in Hawaii. The doctors said he died several times that day just getting to the hospital.

He came back. He always came back. That's what Massfellers do.

### The Connection

I have always been great at explaining extremely complicated concepts to less-than-technical folks. For nearly ten years I wasn't Ryan — I was "the WiFi Guy." "Oh you're *that* guy." "I can't print." My pleasure to help, I would say, as I would not only locate the source of the saved credential in their Windows L/PEAP profile but also hold their hand to the resolution so they would better understand how to not end up in this same position 89 days from now. Yes there were rude people, but for the most part I was someone's hero every single day, to a world that was too close to the problem to see the solution.

I learned to translate between worlds from a lifetime of living between them — between the sighted and the blind, between the technical and the bewildered, between the damaged and the whole. I learned it from sitting with Sam while he played piano. I learned it from watching Beaver dice dates with hands that had been clinically dead hours before. That's why I can talk to AI the way I do. It wasn't a prompt engineering course. It was family.

When I asked Gemini to describe this project for someone with vision loss, I wasn't testing a chatbot. I was talking to my Uncle Sam. And when the response came back — describing the cold weight of a die-cast car in your hand, the ping of the LiDAR arming, the roar of a Formula Vee flat-4 paying tribute to my father — I began sobbing. It hit me like an ancestral anvil.

## What This Means for the Theme

I want the status bar to look like a scanner segment display — the car weight sitting where the frequency number goes. I want a 76 ball hiding in the corner with the version number. I want the track silhouette as an SVG because that tri-oval shape is burned into my retinas. I want Mardi Gras beads haphazardly strewn somewhere, because if you've been to Daytona in February, you know exactly what those beads mean. I want the Internal Affairs page renamed to Pit Road or the Body Shop. And I want to leave easter eggs for my father, knowing full well he will never understand this project or probably even take the time to look. But they'll be there. Because that's what you do for the people who put you in the grandstands.
